Tasks: Attempted to figure out github's API (took a lot of time to interpret, not intuitive for newbies like me!).  Started an outline of data input/output and objects needed for javascript.  Created the HTML shell to contain finished product.  Attempted to write code for ajax using lecture material as a reference.  Will probably have to scrap initial draft when I figure out the rest of the javascript structure.
